# mobius-score
Mobius Score is an open source application that autogenerates sheet music from MP3 files of piano music. We use librosa to extract a song's tempo and to partition it into beats. We then use TensorFlow to process the music and determine the exact notes that were played, which are then transcribed into sheet music in MusicXML format.

First created at HackGT 2017.
